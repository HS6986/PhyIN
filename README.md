# PhyIN
PhyIN sequence alignment trimming

Version 0.991 September 2024

Wayne Maddison

This is an almost ready pre-release of the PhyIN method for trimming alignments for phylogenomics work.

The primary release of PhyIN is in Java within the Mesquite environment (http://www.mesquiteproject.org). However, I provide this python code for use in bioinformatics pipelines.

It is currently built to handle only nucleotide data and fasta files.
